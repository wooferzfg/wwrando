## Information

The plandomizer only supports the North American GameCube version of Wind Waker. (MD5: d8e4d45af2032a081a0f446384e9261b)  
The European and Japanese versions of Wind Waker won't work, and neither will Wind Waker HD.

### Running the plandomizer from source

If you want to run the latest development version of the plandomizer from source, follow the instructions below.  
Note that this is only recommended for advanced users or those interested in helping develop the plandomizer.  

Download and install git from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads  
Then clone this repository with git by running this in a command prompt:  
`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LagoLunatic/wwrando.git`  

Download and install Python 3.12 from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3121/  
"Windows installer (64-bit)" is the one you want if you're on Windows, "macOS 64-bit universal2 installer" if you're on Mac.  
If you're on Linux, run this command instead: `sudo apt-get install python3.12`  

Open the wwrando folder in a command prompt and install dependencies by running:  
`py -3.12 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (on Windows)  
`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (on Mac)  
`python3 -m pip install $(cat requirements.txt) --user` (on Linux)  

Then run the plandomizer with:    
`py wwrando.py` (on Windows)  
`python3 wwrando.py` (on Mac)  
`python3 wwrando.py` (on Linux)  

Optionally, you can also install `requirements_full.txt` with the same process you used for `requirements.txt` above.  
`requirements_full.txt` will install additional libraries that speed up texture recoloring, as well as for building a distributable version of the plandomizer. You can still run the plandomizer from source without these.
