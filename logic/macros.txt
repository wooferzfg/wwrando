Can Defeat ReDeads:
  Progressive Sword x1
  | Progressive Bow x3
  | Skull Hammer
  | Bombs
Can Defeat Poes:
  Nothing
  # You don't need Mirror Shield because you can simply lure them into the light ray.
Can Defeat Poes Without Light Ray:
  Progressive Sword x1
  | Progressive Bow x1
  | Boomerang
  | Hookshot
  | Skull Hammer
  | Grappling Hook
  | Bombs
  # You can knock the lantern out of its hands, then let it possess you and eventually it will disappear.
  # Or you can just shoot it with Light Arrows which is easier - but that doesn't need to be in logic since if you have the bow you can knock the lantern out of its hands instead.
Can Defeat Jalhalla Poes:
  Progressive Sword x1
  | Progressive Bow x1
  | Bombs
  | Skull Hammer
  # Note: Grappling Hook stuns Poes, but doesn't damage them.
Can Defeat Stalfos:
  Progressive Sword x1
  | Bombs
  | Skull Hammer
  | Progressive Bow x3
  # Some other items can damage the head once you break the body apart, but you still need sword/bombs/hammer/light arrows to break it apart in the first place.
Can Defeat Floormasters:
  Progressive Sword x1
  | Progressive Bow x1
  # Skull Hammer also works, but because of the wonky hitbox on floormasters there's a very high chance you'll miss and get taken back to the dungeon entrance, so it's not in the logic.
  # Bombs also work, but it's very annoying to hit them since they throw the bombs back at you. They also go back in the ground becoming invulnerable if you get too far away.
  # Progressive Bow x1 would only be an issue if you run out of arrows when you need to kill a ton of Floormasters - aka the Earth Temple foggy Floormaster room. But thankfully that room has tons of skulls that drop arrow refills.
Can Defeat Morths:
  Progressive Sword x1
  | Boomerang
  | Progressive Bow x1
  | Hookshot
  # Skull Hammer technically works but it's extremely annoying to hit them with. Same with bombs.
Can Defeat Rats:
  Progressive Sword x1
  | Progressive Bow x1
  | Bombs
  | Boomerang
  | Skull Hammer
  | Grappling Hook
  # Hookshot pulls them towards you but doesn't appear to damage them. Actually, it seems Hookshot can rarely push them out of bounds.
  # Skull Hammer also stuns them if you hit the ground near them.
Can Defeat Bombchus:
  Progressive Sword x1
  | Progressive Bow x1
  | Boomerang
  | Skull Hammer
  | Grappling Hook
Can Cut Down Dexivines:
  Progressive Sword x1
  | Progressive Bow x1
  | Bombs
  | Boomerang
  | Skull Hammer
  | Grappling Hook
  | Hookshot
Can Defeat Dexivines:
  Impossible
  # They never die forever, they come back the instant they're cut down.
  # Things that trigger when all enemies are dead will never trigger.
Can Defeat Freshwater Octoroks:
  Progressive Bow x1
  | Boomerang
  | Hookshot
  # The sword and shield can be used to reflect projectiles back at them to kill them, but this only works if the player is at the same horizontal level as the Octorok, otherwise it won't shoot projectiles in the first place.
  # Bombs can also kill them, but they only work in situations where you can actually throw a bomb far enough to reach them. Even then, the timing is very precise because the bomb will be defused when it hits the water.
Can Defeat Saltwater Octoroks:
  Progressive Bow x1
  | Boomerang
  | Hookshot
  # Bombs work when fired from KoRL's cannon, but if a Saltwater Octorok got placed somewhere not in the sea you couldn't use the cannon, and it's too hard to hit them by throwing bombs.
Can Defeat Beamos:
  Nothing
  # Beamos do not count as alive, and therefore not being able to kill them doesn't stop a room from thinking all enemies in the room are dead.
Can Defeat Gyorgs:
  Boomerang
  | Progressive Bow x1
  | Hookshot

Can Defeat Gohma:
  Grappling Hook
  # Gohma can be killed with just the Grappling Hook since it damages her eye in the second phase.
Can Defeat Kalle Demos:
  Boomerang
  | (
    Tricked Logic
    & (
      Bombs
      | Progressive Bow x1
    )
  )
  # No sword needed - Kalle Demos can be damaged with just boomerang.
Can Defeat Gohdan:
  (Progressive Bow x1 | Hookshot)
  & Bombs
  # You can use hookshot to shoot all of Gohdan's eyes instead of the bow.
Can Defeat Helmaroc King:
  Skull Hammer
  # Doesn't require a sword or anything - just the hammer both breaks his mask and damages him.

  # Bombs are tricky since you have to repeatedly use hookshot to keep the tongue in place while you wait for the bomb, or you have to aim the hookshot at the bomb to set it off instantly.

Can Destroy Cannons:
  Bombs
  | Boomerang
  # Two hits from the boomerang also destroys cannons.
Can Cut Down Outset Trees:
  Progressive Sword x1
  | Boomerang
  | Skull Hammer
  # Fire Arrows and Bombs don't work.
  # Luring a ChuChu up the hill and having it jump on the trees doesn't work.
  # Carrying the big pig to the trees and enraging it DOES work, it can cut the trees. But this is not currently in the logic because it's obscure and slow to do.
Can Cut Down Hanging DRC Platform:
  Progressive Sword x1
  | Bombs
  | Progressive Bow x1
  | Skull Hammer
  # Hookshot and Grappling Hook can also technically cut the ropes, but it's too precise to aim them.
  # Boomerang can't cut them at all.
Can Cut Grass:
  Progressive Sword x1
  | Skull Hammer
  | Boomerang
  | Bombs
Can Sword Fight with Orca:
  (
  Progressive Sword x1
  | In Swordless Mode
  )
  & Can Travel to Outset Island
  # Swordless gives you a sword temporarily while in Orca's house, so you don't need to have found a sword item.
