    # Note: If you already have the bow you can get the statue guy across the previous room without getting this item, which might appear to make this chest permanently missable, but in reality you can use the deactivated Armos from across the pit to keep the button pressed.
    # Note: Normally the only way to do this would be to use Command Melody on the statue guy, but if you already have the bow you can activate the moving platforms and use the deactivated Armos from across the pit to keep the button pressed instead.
    # Note: You can reach this without Grappling Hook if you have Deku Leaf instead. But if you run out of MP you can get trapped and not be able to escape since there are no MP refill jars on this side of the gap. So we modify one of the pots to drop an MP refill jar.

    # * The alternate path is to hookshot up the trees on the side path to reach the upper level of the hub room, then glide down to where the iron switch is and do the many cyclones room backwards. If you don't have the magic meter upgrade you still need to refill your magic - but there's conveniently a skull that always drops a large magic refill, so you can just barely make it.
